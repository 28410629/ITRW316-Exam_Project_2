# ITRW316-Exam_Project_2

Write a web system (.NET, PHP, Node, etc) that ask the user for information on a number of processes, the arrival time (start time) as well as how long each process should execute.  Save this data in a database on the web server (MySQL / SQL Express / MongoDB / etc)  On another page the user should be able to set 3 "sliders" to indicate the time quantum of each queue in MQ scheduling.  Queue 1 is shorter or equal to queue 2, queue 2 is shorter or equal to queue 3.  Show the MQ scheduling of the processes (as saved in the table) using these time quantum values.  Deploy the solution on :

    Windows VM with IIS (.NET system)
    OR
    Linux VM with AMP/MEAN (PHP/Node system)

Write a report on the project, give background on scheduling, what the issues/goals where, the possible solutions that might be used, as well as the development you did on the system.  (3 to 5 pages).  Don't submit anything here.  All exam reports will be submitted as one report on eFundi under "Eksamen verslag / Exam report".  Work in groups of 2 or 3.  Code MUST be on git!  (Private repository)
